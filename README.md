# SQL_Final_Exam
Final exam data K7 SQL (Coding Mentor)

In the final SQL exam of data K7, I was given a dataset about doctors in a hospital and 1 hour to read and understand the databset (including drawing an ERD to dive deeper into the relationships between entities in the dataset).
After that, I was given a list of questions and then had to answer those questions in 1.5 hours using MySQL workbench.

File attached:
01 dataset of hospital.
01 text file of exam questions and my answer for each questions.
01 ERD file about relationship between entities in the dataset.
